    <h1>Sugar Cookies</h1>
    This chewy sugar cookie recipe makes delicious cookies that are crisp on the outside and very chewy on the inside. Just the way I like them! 
    <br>These cookies are meant to be shaped or dropped. This recipe can easily be made into snickerdoodle cookies by rolling the dough in cinnamon sugar before baking.
